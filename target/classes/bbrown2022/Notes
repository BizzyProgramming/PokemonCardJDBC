Notes 



Add this file to repository on Github

create update method

// Got rid of this
create type holographic, v, vmax 

If I wanted to add more columns, for example, Market Price and My Price

Add new column, type(bug, fire, etc.) (STRING), how to deal with null
Add column, unique id (STRING) 

Get ID's to start from 0 and auto increment
